    "The pre-processing stage involves four steps to load, split, embed, and store documents into a Vector DB (database).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Document Load** : Load the document content.  \n",
    "- **Step 2: Text Split** : Split the document into chunks based on specific criteria.  \n",
    "- **Step 3: Embedding** : Generate embeddings for the chunks and prepare them for storage.  \n",

    "- **Step 5: Retriever** : Define a retriever to fetch results from the database based on the input query. Retrievers use search algorithms and are categorized as Dense or Sparse:\n",
    "  - **Dense** : Similarity-based search.\n",
    "  - **Sparse** : Keyword-based search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 6: Prompt** : Create a prompt for executing RAG. The `context` in the prompt includes content retrieved from the document. Through prompt engineering, you can specify the format of the answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 7: LLM** : Define the language model (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 8: Chain** : Create a chain that connects the prompt, LLM, and output.  \n",
