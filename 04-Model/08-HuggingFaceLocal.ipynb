        "\n",
        "**Hugging Face Local Model** enables querying large language models (LLMs) using **computational resources from your local machine, such as CPU, GPU or TPU**, without relying on external cloud services.  \n",

        "    - No usage fees.  \n",

        "    - Fine-tuning and inference require substantial time and resources.  \n",
        "\n",

You can install it using pip:\\n\\n```\\npip install transformers\\n```\\n\\nThen, you can import the models you want to use from the transformers module. For example, to use the BERT model for text classification, you can import it as follows:\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer\\n```\\n\\nThe BERT model is a pre-trained model that can perform various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. The model consists of two parts: the encoder and the classifier. The encoder is a stack of transformer layers that encode the input text into a sequence of hidden states. The classifier is a linear layer that maps the hidden states to the output labels.\\n\\nTo'"
