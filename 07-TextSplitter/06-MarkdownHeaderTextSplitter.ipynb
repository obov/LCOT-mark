        "Context and structure of documents are crucial for effective text embedding. Simply dividing text isn't enough; maintaining semantic connections is key to generating more comprehensive vector representations. This is particularly true when dealing with large documents, as preserving context can significantly enhance the accuracy of subsequent analysis and search operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` splits documents according to specified header sets, managing the content under each header group as separate chunks. This enables efficient content processing while maintaining the document's structural coherence.\n",
